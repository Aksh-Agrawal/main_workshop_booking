## App Redesign and Implementation Details

### 1. What design principles guided your improvements?

I wanted to make the website easy for students to use.
The User-Centric Design was important to us. I made sure the website is simple to navigate and does not confuse students.
I also thought about Simplicity And Clarity.
I removed a lot of things that people do not need to see.
We used space and words in a way so people can understand what they are looking at.
We made sure that everything on the website looks the same.
We did this so the website feels like one thing.
We used words that're relatable  and made sure there is enough difference, between colors.
We thought about the Visual Hierarchy too.

### 2. How did you make sure the application works well on all devices?

To make the application work well on all devices we did a things.
We used a first approach. This means we designed the layouts for bigger device first and then made them work for smaller devices.
We also used Flexbox and Grid. These are tools that help make the layouts flexible and work well on devices.
We used units to measure things. Of using fixed numbers we used things like percentage and relative units like rem and vw/vh.
We tested the application, on different devices. We used tools to see how it would look on different screens and we also tried it on real devices to make sure it worked well.
We did all this to make sure the application is responsive. This means it works well on the application no matter what device people use to access it

### 3. What trade-offs did you make between design and performance?

Balancing visual fidelity and speed required a few key choices:
* We prioritized CSS-based stylistic enhancements (like glassmorphism) to simulate a premium feel without heavily leaning on bloated JavaScript animation libraries.
* While adding immersive full-screen dynamic backgrounds for dashboards, we heavily optimized them so they wouldn't overly drain the battery or processor of mobile devices. Lower fidelity options handle graceful degradation automatically.

### 4. What was the challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?

The challenging part was balancing a modern UI with performance constraints. This was especially hard because most users are students who use devices.
And converting from bigger screen to smaller screen
